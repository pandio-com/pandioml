# Installing Apache Pulsar

When installing PandioML, the Apache Pulsar Python Client gets installed with it.

To make it work, a C++ client needs to be installed. How to install this depends on the operating system you have.

Please follow the instructions found on the Apache Pulsar website for your operating system.
